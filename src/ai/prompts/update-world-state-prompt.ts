## YOUR TASK
Return a NEW, UPDATED world state object.

1.  **Progressive Revelation (Secrets & Evolution):**
    - Examine the secrets for the current node.
    - Does the player's action or the GM's narration satisfy the 'trigger' for a secret that has NOT already been revealed (check \`worldState.nodeStates[<nodeId>].revealedSecrets\`)?
    - If YES:
        - Add the secret's ID to the \`revealedSecrets\` array for the current node in the new \`nodeStates\` map.
        - Add a summary of the 'revelation' to the top of the \`recentEvents\` list (e.g., "SECRET REVEALED: The strange altar is actually a teleportation device.").
        - Consider if the 'impact' of the secret creates a new \`storyAspect\`.

2.  **Summary**: Briefly update the main summary only if a major plot point was resolved or a significant new direction was revealed. Otherwise, keep it the same.

3.  **Recent Events**: Add a concise summary of this turn's event (action + outcome) to the top of the list. Include any revealed secrets as described above. Keep the list to a maximum of 5 events, removing the oldest if necessary.

4.  **Story Outline & Aspects**: Review the story outline. If this event completes a major objective, remove it. If a major new goal is created, add it. If a new, important story theme or concept was introduced (especially from a secret's impact), add it to `storyAspects`.

5.  **Scene & Location**:
    - If the narration indicates the party moved to a new node/location, update \`currentScene\` with the new node's details.
    - In \`nodeStates\`, update the discovery level for the new node to 'visited'.
    - If the party remains in the same location, update \`currentScene.description\` and \`presentNPCs\` only if the narration explicitly changed them.

6.  **Characters & Factions**: Do not modify characters. Only add to \`knownFactions\` if the narration explicitly introduces a new faction by name.

Return ONLY the updated world state object as valid JSON.
