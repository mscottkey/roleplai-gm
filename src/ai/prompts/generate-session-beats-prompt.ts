## YOUR TASK
Based on all the information above, generate a sequence of 12-18 story beats for Session #{{{sessionNumber}}}.

### Guiding Principles:
1.  **Session Arc:** Structure the beats to form a mini-narrative arc (introduction, rising action, climax). The first beat must pick up directly from the "Last Known Location" and "Recent Events". For Beat 1, strongly prefer 'exploration' or 'investigation' as the \`beatType\` unless the 'Recent Events' clearly indicate the players are already in an active crisis (e.g., a warzone, a chase).
2.  **Player-Driven:** Review the "Recent Events". What did the players focus on? What did they ignore? Generate beats that follow their demonstrated priorities and show the consequences of their inaction (e.g., by advancing a faction clock they ignored).
3.  **Session Break Guidance:** Designate natural stopping points. For beats around the 6, 9, 12, and 15 mark, if they provide a satisfying, temporary conclusion, set \`isPotentialSessionBreak: true\`. This signals a good place for the GM to ask players if they want to continue or end the session.
4.  **Flexible Beats:** A beat should only be marked \`isFlexible: true\` if it is a truly optional side-story or flavor encounter that does not contain critical clues or character introductions essential for the main plot. A beat that reveals a necessary clue or advances a faction clock should not be flexible. Reserve this for skippable side missions or character development scenes that don't block story progression.
5.  **Pacing and Urgency:** If faction clocks are high or victory conditions are nearly met, the pacing should be faster and more urgent, focusing on \`confrontation\` and \`revelation\` beats. If the campaign is early, allow for more \`exploration\` and \`investigation\`.
6.  **Faction Advancement:** A faction's progress is a key driver of tension. Ensure \`expectedFactionAdvancement\` is used to show the world moving in the background, especially if players are not directly engaging with that faction's plans.

### For each beat, you must provide:
-   \`beat\`: The sequence number (1, 2, 3, ...).
-   \`trigger\`: A **concrete and specific** condition that causes this beat to happen or end. Good examples: "Players successfully pick the lock on the chest," "Players defeat the guard captain," "Players question 3+ villagers about the strange lights." Bad examples: "Players investigate the area," "After the fight."
-   \`beatType\`: Choose from "exploration", "investigation", "confrontation", "revelation", "crisis".
-   \`expectedFactionAdvancement\`: Name the faction whose clock is most likely to advance during or after this beat, or "None".
-   \`suggestedLocation\`: The title of the node where this beat is likely to occur.
-   \`description\`: A 1-2 sentence description of what happens in the beat.
-   \`isFlexible\`: \`true\` if this beat is optional, \`false\` if it is critical to the main plot.
-   \`isPotentialSessionBreak\`: \`true\` if this beat serves as a good stopping point for the session.

Return the result as a single, valid JSON array of StoryBeat objects. Do not include any extra text or explanations.`;
