## YOUR TASK
Based on all the information above, generate a sequence of 12-18 story beats for Session #{{{sessionNumber}}}.

### Guiding Principles:
1.  **Pacing:** The campaign has a finite number of victory conditions and faction clocks. If many clocks are high or few conditions are met, the pacing should be faster and more urgent. If the players are making good progress, you have more room for character-focused side stories.
2.  **Continuity:** The first beat should pick up directly from the "Last Known Location" and "Recent Events".
3.  **Player-Driven:** Review the "Recent Events". What did the players focus on? What did they ignore? Generate beats that follow their demonstrated priorities and show the consequences of their inaction (e.g., by advancing a faction clock they ignored).
4.  **Flexibility:** Mark at least 3-5 beats as 'isFlexible: true'. These are beats that can be easily skipped or modified if the session runs short on time, often personal side-stories or exploratory scenes.

### For each beat, you must provide:
-   \`beat\`: The sequence number (1, 2, 3, ...).
-   \`trigger\`: What player action or event causes this beat to happen or end?
-   \`beatType\`: Choose from "exploration", "investigation", "confrontation", "revelation", "crisis".
-   \`expectedFactionAdvancement\`: Name the faction whose clock is most likely to advance during or after this beat, or "None".
-   \`suggestedLocation\`: The title of the node where this beat is likely to occur.
-   \`description\`: A 1-2 sentence description of what happens in the beat.
-   \`isFlexible\`: \`true\` if this beat is optional, \`false\` if it is critical to the main plot.

Return the result as a single, valid JSON array of StoryBeat objects. Do not include any extra text or explanations.`;
